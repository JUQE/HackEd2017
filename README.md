Welcome to JUQE
Prepare to democratize the dance floor

For too long have dancers suffered under the tyranny of pretentious DJs and people who hog the aux chord

A DJ curated pool of songs is voted on by the users and the most popular songs are played via the DJs device.

Songs are pulled from Spotify and data stored on firebase.
DJ must have a Spotify account.

Made in under 24 hours.
